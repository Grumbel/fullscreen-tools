sdl-hack
========

sdl-hack is a simple LD_PRLOAD based hack that lets you get between
SDL and a game to override specific behaviour. For example if a game
requests fullscreen mode and provides no option to switch to window
mode, you can force it to be in window mode.

Usage:

 $ sdl-hack APPNAME

# EOF #
